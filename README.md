## Functions
- all data is saved in localStorage
- each project can be assigned tasks

- a project record must exist in order to create task records!
## Future features
- 'stats' tab to oversee time spent on each project over a period of time (7d / mo /year)
- dynamic timer in document.title
- pausing the timer
## How to Use
1. **Open the app**: Simply open the HTML file in your browser.
2. **Add Projects**: Click on the "New project" button and enter the project name.
3. **Add Tasks**: For each project, you can add tasks. Either use the form to manually enter the start and end times, or use the timer to track time automatically.
